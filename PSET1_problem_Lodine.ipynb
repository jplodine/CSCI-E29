    "Mr. Wensleydale's cheese shop is unusually well stocked today -- he has both Emmentaler and Jarlsberg cheese available. Between the two varieties, there are a total of 20 wheels of cheese. Curiously, each variety comes in perfectly uniform wheels, but the two varieties have different numbers of holes per wheel: there are 200 holes in each wheel of Emmentaler, and 150 in each wheel of Jarlsberg. There are 3400 holes in the entire inventory. Use numpy to determine how many wheels of each variety are available.\n",

Numpy's linear algebra module *linalg* includes the **inv** function for finding the inverse of a matrix, and the **dot** method for multiplying two matrices.
